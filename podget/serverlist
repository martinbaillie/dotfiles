# Default Server List for podget
#
# FORMAT:    <url> <category> <name>
#
# NOTES:
#    1. URL Rules:
#      A. Any spaces in the URL need to be converted to %20
#    2. Category Rules:
#      A.  Must be one word without spaces.
#      B.  You may use underscores and dashes.
#      C.  You can insert date substitions.
#          %YY%  ==  Year
#          %MM%  ==  Month
#          %DD%  ==  Day
#    3. Name Rules:
#      A.  If you are creating ASX playlists, make sure the feed name does not
#          have any spaces in it and the filename cannot be blank.
#      B.  You can leave the feed name blank, and files will be saved in the
#          category directory.
#      C.  Names with spaces are only compatible with filesystems that allow for spaces
#          in filenames.  For example, spaces in feed names are OK for feeds saved to
#          Linux ext partitions but are not OK for those saved to Microsoft FAT partitions.
#    4. Disable the downloading of any feed by commenting it out with a leading #.
#
# Examples:
#   http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss Linux LUG Radio
#
# Example with date substitution in the category and a blank feed name:
#   http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/summary/rss.xml News-%YY%-%MM%-%DD%
#
# Example of two ways to do a feed with authentication:
#   http://somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name USER:username PASS:password
#     OR
#   http://username:password@somesite.com/feed.rss CATEGORY Feed Name
#
#   NOTE:   The second method will fail if a colon (:) is part of the username or password.
#           Both methods will fail if a space is part of the username or password.
