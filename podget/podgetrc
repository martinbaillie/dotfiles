# Filename Suffix:

# Add suffix to the filename of every file downloaded to allow for subsequent scripts to detect the newly downloaded files and work
# on them.  Examples of this would be scripts to run id3v2 to force a standard genre for all MP3 files downloaded or to use mp3gain
# to normalize files to have the same volume.
#
# A period (.) will automatically be added between the filename and tag like so:
#       fileanme.mp3.newtag
#
# Tags will not be added to filenames as they are added to the playlists.  It will be necessary for any script that you run to
# process the files remove the tag for the playlists to work.
#
# If this variable is undefined or commented out, then by default no suffix will be added.

# Downloaded Filename Cleanup Options:

# Filename Cleanup: For FAT32 filename compatability (Feature Request #1378956)
# Tested with the following characters: !@#$%^&*()_-+=||{[}]:;"'<,>.?/
#
# The \`, \" and \\ characters need to be escaped with a leading backslash.
#
# Bad Character definitions need to be surrounded in quotes.

# When you run podget at a VERBOSITY of 3 or 4, it may appear that the filename format fixes are done out of order.  That is because
# they are named as they are created and as new fixes have been developed, those with more detailed exclusionary conditions have had
# to be done before those with more generic conditions.  Looking for improvements to fix this issue.

# Filename Cleanup 2:  Some RSS Feeds (like the BBC World News Bulletin)
# download files with names like filename.mp3?1234567.  Enable this mode
# to fix the format to filename1234567.mp3.

# Filename Cleanup 3: Filenames of feeds hosted by LBC Plus corrupted.
# Fixed per MoonUnit's feature request (#1660764)
#
# Takes an URL that looks like:  http://lbc.audioagain.com/shared/audio/stream.mp3?guid=2007-03/14<...snip>
#                            <snip...>a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# Which normally creates a file named: a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# This fix extracts the date of the episode and changes the filename to 2007-03-14.mp3

# 1 == enabled (default)
FILENAME_FORMATFIX2=1

# Filename Cleanup 4: Filenames of feeds hosted by CatRadio.cat need fixing.
# Fixed per Oriol Rius's Bug Report (#1744705)
#
# Downloaded filenames look like: 1189153569775.mp3?programa=El+mat%ED+de+Catalunya+R%E0dio&amp;podcast=y
# This fix removes everything after the .mp3

# Filename Cleanup 5:  When the filename is part of the URL and the actual filename stays the same for
# all items listed.
#
# Download URLs look like: http://feeds.theonion.com/~r/theonion/radionews/~5/213589629/podcast_redirect.mp3
# Where 213589629 is the unique filename.
#
# This filename change is disabled by default because it may cause unintended changes to the filename.

# Filename Cleanup 6: Remove "?referrer=rss" from the end of filenames as included in some feeds like
# those from Vimcasts.org.  Setup to work for MP3, M4V, OGG and OGV files.
#
# Feed URLs: http://vimcasts.org/feeds/ogg
#            http://vimcasts.org/feeds/quicktime

# Filename Cleanup 7:  Removes the trailing part of the filename after the '?'.
# Fixed at the request of Joerg Schiermeier
#
# For dealing with enclosures like those formatted in the ZDF podcast.
# Feed URL: http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/podcast/1193018?view=podcast
# Example enclosure:

# Filename Cleanup 8:
# This fix is for feeds that assign the same filename to be downloaded for each
# enclosure and then embedded the actual filename of the object to be saved in
# the media_url= parameter.  This fix extracts that name and uses it for the
# saved file.
#
# 0 == disabled
# 1 == enabled (default)
FILENAME_FORMATFIX7=1

# Filename Cleanup 9:
# This fix is for feeds like Smodcast.  It removes the "?client_id=<string>"
# from the end of each enclosure url in the feed.
#
# NOTE:  To fully fix the filenames on feeds like Smodcast, this fix should
# be used in conjunction with FILENAME_FORMATFIX4.
#
# Example URL: http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62837276/stream.mp3?client_id=a427c512429c9c90e58de7955257879c

# 1 == enabled (default)

# Filename Cleanup 10:
#
# This is a fix for podcast feeds formatted like those for Audioboo.  Removes everything after the ?
# in the filename.  Attempted to make this fix generic enough to work with a variety of feeds of mp3, mp4,
# ogg and ogv files.
#
# Feed URL: http://audioboo.fm/users/39903/boos.rss
# Example URL: http://audioboo.fm/boos/1273271-mw-123-es-wird-fruhling.mp3?keyed=true&amp;source=rss
# Fixed Filename: 1273271-mw-123-es-wird-fruhling.mp3

# 1 == enabled (default)
FILENAME_FORMATFIX9=1

# Filename Cleanup 11:
#
# This is an attempt to fix feeds hosted on Apple ITunes.  The enclosure URL from these feeds defines the
# the filename as a long string of numbers and letter.  It's not very descriptive.  However, after the
# filename and a '?', in the information passed down to the application as part of the URL, we can
# extract the episode name for each podcast.  It is that name that this fix will use for the filename,
# with a few character replacements to insure good filenames.
